        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Welcome! I’m Anushree Sanjai, a passionate designer currently pursuing a degree in Experience Design with a minor in Psychology at FLAME University, Pune. My work centers around creating thoughtful, user-centered experiences that combine aesthetic appeal with functional, intuitive design.</p>

        <p>I’m driven to create a classic, timeless brand identity that appeals to high-end clients and established companies. This journey is about learning, growing, and challenging myself to become not only a skilled designer but also an entrepreneur.
          In my work, I’m inspired by vintage aesthetics and the timeless appeal of classic design, which I aim to bring into both digital and physical experiences.</p>
        <p>Beyond design, I’m invested in personal growth, fitness, and sharing insights through my future podcast, where I’ll invite guests to discuss life skills and self-development. This is a space where I explore and share my creative journey, so I invite you to follow along as I continue to evolve and learn in this field.
          Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy browsing my portfolio! </p>
